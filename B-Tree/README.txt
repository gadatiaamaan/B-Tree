This file will show you exactly how to run and execute my program!

WELCOME TO THIS B-TREE
This program will begin by asking the user for an input for the number of elements in the tree. This input must be a number greater than 400 as required
in the assignment description. The program will then randomly generate however many number of elements between the numbers of 0 and N*3. No number will
be shown twice in the program. 

In order to run this program, simple type "make run" into the terminal and the program will execute.
This will then ask for the input of the number of elements to insert into the b-tree which must be greater than or equal to 400.
This input will then be used to find an output any elements between the inputed number and two times that number.
The program will first output all of the random key elements that were generated in the way they are found in the tree.
Then the program will output the elements between the inputed number and two times that number.

After running the program input "make clean" to get rid of the junk files that result from the program.

Have fun!!
